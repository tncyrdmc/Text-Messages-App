From the assignment instructions:

"This assignment is all about networking, and to get your hands on the network, you will implement a simple version
of WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a real time messaging app where everyone can open a user and send messages,
receive messages,and create groups. You will implement your WhatsApp in two steps:
1) write a WhatsApp client, 2) write your very own WhatsApp server."
